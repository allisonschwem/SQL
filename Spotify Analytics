# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data as a CSV file.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

Select
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Group by artist_name, track_name

#Determine who the Top 10 artists are by popularity

Select 
track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10

#Find artists whose songs are, on average, have the most danceability


Select
artist_name
, avg(danceability)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name

#Determine which artists released the longest songs

Select
artist_name
,track_name
,duration_ms
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Order by duration_ms desc;
