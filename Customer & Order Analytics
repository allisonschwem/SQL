#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

--In this circumstance, there was incomplete data in the table where instead of having a 6 digit order id, it would say "Order ID."
      --In the real world, we would most likely want to pull the incomplete data specifically to fix it and identify weak points in processes.
      --Other than running a query to specifically pull up these instances, I would consider using a CASE to flag these outliers.

--Additionally, my instructions were to specifically only use order ids with 6 digits and consider any more to be incorrect.
      --In the real world, this may not be the case. A different format for order id could mean any number of things like variation of vendor, 
        a CS corrected/altered order, or a need to expand from 6 to 7 digits to ensure unique order ids in the future.
          --If I knew there were always a minimum of 6 digits in an order id, I would change the =6 to >=6
          --Alternatively, I could run a query to isolate order ids over 6 digits using >6 to be reviewed for errors.
